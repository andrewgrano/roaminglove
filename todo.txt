TO DO

- enable https via netlify admin
- build contribute form
- google pagespeedinsights - .section is too wide by 5px
- mask email address via mailgun
- minified CSS and JS
- add comments via disqus
- hover effects for widgets (velocity?) & all links
- index header carousel:  most recent 3-4 posts. Use featured image, title and date. (Use moment.js to display      "today", "yesterday", "2 days ago", etc.)
- contribute form: remember users typed entries on-refresh (cookies? jquery cookies?)
- LONGSHOT: at the end of an article, add section for "on this trip, I also went to...". Similar to bottom of this article: https://scotch.io/bar-talk/the-complete-visual-guide-to-sublime-text-3-themes-color-schemes-and-cool-features
