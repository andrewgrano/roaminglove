TO DO

- enable https via netlify admin
- build contribute form
- setup "author" on _single.jade
- hotels.jade - title on mobile
- google pagespeedinsights - .section is too wide by 5px
- meta data: make it unique to each page
- mask email address via mailgun
- hover effects for widgets (velocity?) & all links
- index header carousel:  most recent 3-4 posts. Use featured image, title and date. (Use moment.js to display      "today", "yesterday", "2 days ago", etc.)
- contribute form: remember users typed entries on-refresh (cookies? jquery cookies?)
