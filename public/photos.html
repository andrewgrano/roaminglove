      <h1>Vietnam &amp;#038; Cambodia: Recap</h1>
      <p>April 18, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>Andrew and I made it safely back to Los Angeles after a 20 hour day of travel. 12 hours after landing, I got sick with a cold. I&#8217;m still recovering from a sore throat now. I can only say I am happy to be sick in my own bed than on an airplane or in a foreign country!</p>
<p>Visiting Southeast Asia was a life changing trip. For the longest time, I never imagined myself exploring Asia. I wanted to visit Europe so badly. After my trip to Italy, I suddenly became interested in other parts of the world. I am glad my curiosity led me to Vietnam and Cambodia. The people of Vietnam and Cambodia were nothing but gracious. I never once felt discriminated against in either country.</p>
<p>My favorite things about Vietnam:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motorbike rides through Hanoi &#8211; Cheap and safe but mostly, very exhilarating</li>
<li>Deep fried pork ribs &#8211; I ate these at the Bia Hoi and I would eat them again</li>
<li>The Old Quarter  &#8211; So much to see and great bargain shopping. You can haggle with almost every shop owner for a better deal.</li>
<li>Cheap taxi and Uber rides &#8211; We didn&#8217;t take a ride over $5 USD our entire time in Hanoi</li>
<li>How kind and honest the people are &#8211; They help you convert your currency without ripping you off. It took some time to get used to the Dong bills but it was nice to know that the Vietnamese people only want to help you</li>
<li>Meeting people from around the world &#8211; From random bars to our Dragon Legend junk cruise, you are constantly meeting people from all parts of the world</li>
</ul>
<p>My favorite things about Cambodia:</p>
<ul>
<li>How affordable a 4 star hotel is ($55 for Diamond D’Angkor Boutique: http://www.diamondangkor.com/) This is where we stayed and I would highly recommend it. The rooms are large and the staff are more than accommodating. They organized all of our tuk tuk rides to and from the temples. They even gave us a to-go breakfast when we wanted to see the sunrise at 5:30 am at Angkor Wat!</li>
<li>Angkor Archaeological Park &#8211; After 3 days of temple hopping, it wasn&#8217;t near enough time for this park. Although the heat was suffocating, I would recommend everyone make the trek to Angkor Park one day</li>
<li>How innocent the children are &#8211; Riding on a tuk tuk through Cambodia allowed me to see lots of small children running around. It was the first time in a long time that I saw kids being kids. No cell phones, iPods or laptops. They were playing with toys and small water guns. They were chasing each other and laughing. It was a beautiful sight!</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t know when I will visit Asia again but I know I want to go back. After being there, I realized I wanted to explore more Asian countries. I want to visit Japan soon!</p>
<p><strong>Where to next? </strong>Well, Andrew and I have given ourselves till May 1st to book our honeymoon. We think we know where we are going but I won&#8217;t give it away yet!!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading about my trip to Vietnam &amp; Cambodia! I really enjoyed blogging and I will be doing it again for my next trip.</p>

      <h1>3D Museum</h1>
      <p>April 16, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>After our stay on the Dragon Legend cruise, we stayed another night in a hotel near Halong Bay. The hotel was called Royal Lotus hotel and I would highly recommend it. The staff was friendly and the room was spacious.</p>
<p>We were in the area during off season so there really wasn&#8217;t many people around. We explored the surrounding area of the hotel and all we could find was a night market and a dead mall. Or so we thought! Located inside this mall is a 3D museum. I imagine this place to be completely packed during the summer but when we went, we were the only ones there!</p>
<p>The museum is huge, spanning 2 seperate buildings. There are 3D paintings that you become apart of. Since we were the only customers, an employee decided to be our personal tour guide and photographer. She helped us pose for every photo and insisted on us taking photos together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrew and I had so much fun running around this place! I Imagine it to be less enjoyable when its very busy but we got so lucky!</p>

      <h1>Halong Bay</h1>
      <p>April 14, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>After Cambodia, Andrew and I took a 4 hour shuttle bus to Halong Bay. We had a 1 night Junk cruise booked. A junk boat is what the cruise ships are called at Halong Bay. They are not junky at all. The day before we departed, we received an email letting us know that we had been upgraded to a more luxury cruise!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We arrived at the Halong harbor with throngs of other tourists waiting to embark on their overnight cruises. Our boat was called &#8220;Dragon Legend.&#8221; This was my first time on a cruise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9487-1.jpg"><img src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9487-1.jpg" alt=""></a>&nbsp;<br />
It was such a beautiful experience. Halong Bay is filled with massive limestone rocks that jet out from the water like icebergs. A junk cruise is the best way to get up close to them. We sailed through the rocks during sunset. I was stunned by the natural beauty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9529.jpg"><img src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9529.jpg" alt=""></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

The crew on board was wonderful! They made sure to remember our food allergies whenever food was being served. It was great to meet other tourists from all over the world. We spoke to people from Australia, Spain, England and even Argentina.</p>
<p>You can also kayak, swim and explore a nearby cave. A junk cruise when visiting Halong Bay is a must!</p>

      <h1>Community Tourism</h1>
      <p>April 14, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>After exploring the Banteay Srei temple, we walked further and found a group of locals who offer canoe rides on a lake. After paying $12 USD for 3 of us, we got on a boat with our guide. This turned out to be one of my favorite experiences in Cambodia!</p>
<p>Our guide spoke broken English but was very interested in our lives. He asked about California and he mentioned liking Obama. He let us know that he is 23 years old and desperately wants to attend University. Unfortuntely, school is simply too expensive in Cambodia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9442.jpg"><img src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9442.jpg" alt=""></a>&nbsp;<br />
He also spoke about wanting to get married but being unable to afford the costs associated with a wedding. He was pleased to find out that Andrew and I will wed in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ride was soothing and very eye opening. It was amazing to see the beautiful lake and lily pads. I will never forget this unique experience. We were all pleased to know our money goes directly to the locals, who run the small boat service. There was not another tourist in sight! That really added to the quiet landscape.</p>

      <h1>Banteay Srei</h1>
      <p>April 13, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>On our last day in Siem Reap, Cambodia, we visited a Hindu Temple located 22 miles from our hotel. We took a tuk tuk there. It was so great to see more of Cambodia while listening to our ipods on the 1 hour long tuk tuk ride. We arrived at the temple with lots of other tourists. The temple is still located within the Angkor Wat park.</p>
<p>This particular temple was the most intricate temple of our trip. The carvings are so well preserved!</p>
<p><a href="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9420.jpg"><img src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9420.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
<a href="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9426.jpg"><img src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9426.jpg" alt="" /></a>  <a href="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9423.jpg"><img src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9423.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
The temple area has a botanical garden, roaming water buffalo and many view points. Although this temple is farther away from town, it is totally worth the trek.</p>

      <h1>Pub Street</h1>
      <p>April 13, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>After another long day of visiting temples, we decided to visit the much talked about Pub Street. Luckily, it was walking distance from our hotel. Pub Street is a few blocks of various bars and restaurants. I had heard mixed reviews from friends who had visited before us.</p>
<p>We ate dinner on Pub Street and it was the most expensive meal of our trip. We didn&#8217;t order anything fancy but I suppose Pub Street is catered towards tourists. After dinner, we walked up and down Pub Street to see what all the hype was about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have much to say about it because it was SUCH a dumb tourist trap. It was filled with large groups of men, just walking up and down. There was loud music blasting from all directions. Locals were charging tourists 50 cents to take photos of cooked beetles and spiders. There really wasn&#8217;t much going on!</p>
<p>Maybe I was there on an off night but Pub Street was not for me. We didn&#8217;t stay long and instead, wandered off to another night market that ended up being a lot more entertaining.</p>

At almost every temple we visited over our 3 day trip to the Angkor Wat park, we were greeted by victims of landmines. They sit at the entrance of the temples and play beautiful music for donations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of them had a missing leg or arm. We donated to these groups at various temples. It was crazy to see these local people playing music after suffering such a tragic accident.</p>
<p>Enjoy the short video!</p>

      <h1>Siem Reap Night Market</h1>
      <p>April 10, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>Our hotel in Cambodia was located a short walk from a bustling night market. After a long day at the temples, we mustered up the energy to explore the market. I am glad we did! I absolutely loved it.</p>
<p>In Cambodia, you can haggle with any shop owner. I was able to purchase many souvenirs and gifts for my friends and family. The market sold everything from clothing, jewelry, food and various trinkets. Cambodia uses the US dollar. I don&#8217;t think I purchased anything over $3 at the night market.</p>
<p>I would recommend a quick visit here if you have a free night in Siem Reap, Cambodia. The locals were very friendly and they love to ask where you are from. It was great talking to them while browsing their shops.</p>
