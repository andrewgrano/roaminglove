      <h1>Colombia: Recap</h1>
      <p>August 23, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>Colombia is a beautiful country with hard-working and kind people. We didn&#8217;t have any issue with anyone our entire time in the country. People were so interested to hear about California (our home state). The Colombian jungle is refreshing and the waters along the coast are warm.</p>

<ul>
<li>Colombia is being flooded with tourists who finally understand that the country is no longer overrun by drug cartels. Guides, employees and staff members are trying to learn English fast to keep up with the rush of tourism.</li>
<li>Most of the water along the coast is beautiful but wild. There were only a handful of times the water was tame enough to swim in.</li>
<li>There are LOTS of police. You cannot drive down the street for more than 10 miles without seeing a police officer or multiple. There are plenty of traffic stops but most of the time, they wave the taxi driver through. In Cartagena, the police walk the streets and ride motorcycles through parks. They are everywhere. We only had a few interactions with them but they seemed to be primarily young men. You cannot walk more than 3 blocks in Cartagena without seeing an officer standing around.</li>
<li>There are lots of dining options in Cartagena. There were so many restaurants but most of them are typically empty. People tended to flock to the same eateries and those places tended to stay busy all day and night. Cartagena isn&#8217;t very big so the amount of restaurants was almost too much for the size of the city.</li>
<li>Cartagena can be seen in 2-3 days. We stayed 6 days and that was admittedly, too long. I don&#8217;t regret how long we spent there because we REALLY know Cartagena now but it wasn&#8217;t completely necessary. Cartagena isn&#8217;t cheap so between your hotel and food costs, it adds up fast. Luckily, this was our honeymoon and we budgeted to spend a bit more than we have previously spent on accommodations/dining out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Colombia was a great choice for our honeymoon. We were able to achieve relaxation, adventure, nature, and city wandering in one trip. It was our first time to South America and I can confidently say it will not be our last.</p>

      <h1>Playa Blanca</h1>
      <p>August 23, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><figure id="attachment_456" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-456 size-full" src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2914_opt.jpg" alt="IMG_2914_opt" width="1000" height="750" srcset="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2914_opt.jpg 1000w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2914_opt-300x225.jpg 300w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2914_opt-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A rare moment of clarity at Playa Blanca</figcaption></figure>
<p>We found a driver to take us to Playa Blanca one afternoon. I was excited to relax on a beach and play in the warm water. Playa Blanca is located 50 minutes from Cartagena. On the drive there, you are stopped several times by police offers. Our I.D.&#8217;s were checked once and the other times, the officers waved us through. We did see other cars being stopped and searched. Upon arrival to Playa Blanca, you will find lots of young men running around your car and screaming into your windows. We didn&#8217;t understand what they were saying but their behavior came across as very belligerent. One of the young men directed our driver to a parking spot. Our driver paid for the parking spot at a booth being controlled by very stern looking men. We walked down to the beach area and were immediately greeted by a man who sold us our beach chairs and canopy for the day. All of the chairs on the beach are owned by various restaurant owners. They will try to sell you a beach chair and a meal. We didn&#8217;t want any food so we just paid for the beach chair. Although we explained we weren&#8217;t going to be eating lunch at the beach, the man came to our chairs about 3-4 times to ask us if we wanted to order food. The menu consisted of tropical drinks, fish dishes, coconut rice and plantain chips. We settled into our chairs and met our neighbors. They were nice young men from Colombia who offered us beer.</p>

<p>We settled into our spot and before we could even get up to go into the water, we were approached by the first vendor. I say the first vendor because we were probably approached by over 30 vendors. They are allowed to walk up and down the beach. They stop at everyone&#8217;s chairs and offer you anything and everything. I am not exaggerating when I say that you will be offered massages, bracelets, inner tubes, hair braiding services, temporary tattoos, alcoholic drinks,  fruit, jet ski rides, boat rides, and sunglasses. At first, it was interesting to see what was being sold but you can only say &#8220;No Gracias&#8221; so many times before you want to punch something. The police also walk up and down the beach but they do not interact with you or the vendors. You can drink on the beach so I think they were just there to show their presence.</p>

<p>Playa Blanca itself is truly beautiful. The water is so clear and warm. The scenery is absolutely stunning. I was shocked that the vendors are allowed to aggressively sell on the beach. I would have no issue if there were markets or stalls set up that you could visit and browse. It was frustrating to be forced to pay for a beach chair, only to be bothered every 5-8 minutes by a vendor, often the same vendor, over and over again. The amount of vendors walking along the sand really took away from the natural beauty of Playa Blanca. It was hard to enjoy ourselves when you have someone interrupting you constantly. By the middle of the afternoon, we just had to laugh at the insanity of Playa Blanca.</p>
<figure id="attachment_455" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-455 size-full" src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_4389_opt.jpg" alt="IMG_4389_opt" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_4389_opt.jpg 1000w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_4389_opt-300x200.jpg 300w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_4389_opt-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Andrew laughing at the zoo that is Playa Blanca</figcaption></figure>

<p>My other issue with Playa Blanca is the activity in the water. The boat and jet ski companies zoom in and out of the water directly where you are swimming. There was more than one time that I was worried that we were going to be hit by a jet ski. They ride around the shallow waters, asking people if they want to ride a jet ski or a banana float. I was genuinely worried for the safety of small children swimming in the water. The water was stunning but the air smelled of fumes and gasoline due to the close proximity of the boats and jet skis. I was disappointed that I didn&#8217;t feel safe swimming in the water. I kept imagining being underwater and a jet ski driving over my head.</p>
<figure id="attachment_462" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-462" src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2946_opt.jpg" alt="Ridiculous amount of boats and ocean tubes near swimmers" width="1000" height="750" srcset="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2946_opt.jpg 1000w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2946_opt-300x225.jpg 300w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2946_opt-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ridiculous amount of boats and ocean tubes near swimmers</figcaption></figure>
<p>I am glad that we experienced Playa Blanca. It is a very authentic experience. I have never been anywhere like it in the world and I am grateful for the time we spent there. Do not go there to relax. You will not be relaxed at all. You will constantly be watching your stuff while you swim in the ocean. You will be constantly politely saying &#8220;No.&#8221; You must go to Playa Blanca to people watch, swim in clear water and laugh a lot.</p>

      <h1>Hotel NH Cartagena Urban Royal</h1>
      <p>August 23, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>We stayed at Hotel NH Cartagena for 5 nights at the end of our Colombian honeymoon. The hotel is located at Plaza de los Coches, which is very active with tourists, tour companies and street vendors. Most of the hotel staff also speaks English so check-in was a breeze. We booked our room through Priceline and when we arrived, they said they didn&#8217;t have our room type available. They put us in a twin room for 1 night and then switched us over to a Superior room the other nights. The rooms feature everything you will need for a comfortable stay, including air conditioning. If you are wanting a guaranteed hot shower though, this is not the place. The water was either freezing, lukewarm or boiling hot. The showers take a very long time to warm up. Some of the rooms face Plaza de los Coches, which is very noisy everyday after sunset and till about 3 am. I would not choose this hotel if you are a light sleeper. You will hear everything from music, police sirens, loud conversations and even fireworks. The noise didn&#8217;t bother us and it was interesting to see how lively the Plaza was!</p>

<p>The hotel offers free breakfast but it is a very disappointing breakfast. The dining room is nice, with windows on all walls and comfortable chairs. The breakfast featured made to order eggs, very tiny croissants and various meat slices. The hotel wasn&#8217;t cheap so I was expecting a better breakfast spread. They have a menu of breakfast foods but they aren&#8217;t included in the inclusive breakfast price. There are breakfast places within walking distance of the hotel so we only ate the hotel breakfast once.</p>

<p>The best part about this hotel is the rooftop pool. The pool was typically empty, which surprised me since it is so nice. It overlooks Cartagena and you can see as far as Bocagrande. We watched a lightning storm from the pool and it was one of the most memorable parts of the entire trip. I recommend this hotel if you are looking for a clean and centrally located hotel within the walls of Cartagena.</p>

      <h1>Getsemani</h1>
      <p>August 22, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>We set aside one afternoon to check out the neighborhood of Getsemani. It is located right outside the walls of Cartagena. We walked from our hotel and past a large traffic circle. Keep walking and you will begin to see signs that say Getsemani. We arrived in the early afternoon and there were not many people out. There is barely any shade in Getsemani so we quickly became hot while wondering the small streets. Bear the heat and check out all of the unique street art. There is a mural or art piece on almost every street. A man came up to us while we were photographing the art and he let us know that almost everyday, there is a free street art guided walking tour of Getsemani.</p>

<p>There are lots of restaurants in Getsemani but we found that most of them do not open until dinnertime. In fact, we went back to Getsemani at nighttime and it was a completely different place. Kids were playing outside in Plaza Trinidad and there were food stands set up. You can&#8217;t miss Plaza Trinidad, which features a giant mustard yellow church. If you really want to get the full Getsemani experience, check out the street art in the daytime and come back for dinner at nighttime.</p>

      <h1>Castillo de San Felipe de Barajas and Convento de la Popa</h1>
      <p>August 19, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>We chose to see San Felipe Castillo and La Popa in one day. They are only a taxi ride away from each other. We started off with San Felipe. The price of admission is 25000 COP per person. They do offer discounts for anyone with a student I.D. I am unsure if we picked a good day/time to visit the fortress but it was really empty. Construction began on the fortress in 1536. It was incredible to tour this fortress, inside and out. There are cannons and underground tunnels beneath the fortress. There is also a little gift shop that sells water. There is no shade at the fortress unless you are underneath so sunblock and water is a must. The castle is very well-preserved. I couldn&#8217;t believe how long ago it was built. Take your time walking around every part of this Cartagena sight.</p>

<p>After spending over an hour at San Felipe Castillo, we hailed a taxi. He took us to La Popa, situated on a high hill. You can see La Popa from the castle. There is no public bus that takes you to La Popa so a taxi or a tour is the only way to get there. We paid our taxi driver to drive us up the hill to La Popa and wait for us to finish touring the convent. The parking lot is an absolute zoo. There were donkeys, tour buses, shops, vendors and throngs of tourists. La Popa was much more crowded than San Felipe Castillo. After paying, we entered and immediately were stunned by the view. You can see everything in Cartagena from La Popa. After admiring the view, we walked around the patio and ducked into the convents chapel. There are a few exhibits to look at but you really cannot spend more than 1 hour here. The amount of people at La Popa is enough to turn most people off. It is worth it for the amazing view bu we didn&#8217;t spend more than 45 minutes here. We were grateful that our taxi driver waited for us and took us back to our hotel for one fee.</p>

      <h1>Cartagena Restaurants: Part 2</h1>
      <p>August 19, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>You can&#8217;t google &#8220;Cartagena Restaurants&#8221; without seeing Di Silvio Trattoria. It is located in Getsemani, a neighborhood located right outside of the old walls of Cartagena. We walked there one night to try this raved about Italian restaurant. We were seated right away but shortly after being seated, there was a wait outside. The restaurant was busy the entire time we dined there. I ordered pizza and Andrew ordered a calzone. It was giant! Both entrees were delicious and large. I would recommend sharing a meal here. The portions are big but the prices were inexpensive.</p>
<figure id="attachment_405" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-405 size-full" src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2897_opt.jpg" alt="IMG_2897_opt" width="1000" height="750" srcset="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2897_opt.jpg 1000w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2897_opt-300x225.jpg 300w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2897_opt-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Enormous calzone</figcaption></figure>
<p>One afternoon while walking the colorful streets of Cartagena, we stumbled upon La Tumbamuertos Burger Bar. The owner speaks English and the food was good. The burgers are large and they come with fries. I couldn&#8217;t finish my burger but the restaurant is a nice place to rest from the heat outside.</p>

<p>I am not a coffee drinker but my husband sure is! Andrew was on the quest to try to the best coffee in Cartagena and I am happy to report he found it at Cafe San Alberto. The baristas are coffee enthusiasts and couldn&#8217;t wait to tell us about why this coffee is so special. We shared a brownie while Andrew had an espresso. He loved the coffee so much that he bought San Alberto coffee beans to bring home with us.</p>

<p>If you are craving authentic Italian pizza, do not go anywhere else but La Diva. We ate here twice because the pizza was some of the best pizza we have ever had. It was just as authentic as any pizza we ate in Italy. They have a large wine selection. I recommend the Chilean Rose wines! The place is always packed so expect to wait for a table. It is completely worth it. The pizza was so delicious that we didn&#8217;t even pause to take a photo of it!</p>
<p>You will find lots of street vendors while walking the small streets of Cartagena. They sell everything from blenders to shoelaces. They also sell lots of fried Colombian food like arepas and empanadas. You can find fresh fruit on any street corner at any time of day. The prices are very inexpensive and the vendors are kind.</p>

      <h1>Cartagena Restaurants</h1>
      <p>August 19, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>We spent a total of 6 nights in Cartagena, Colombia at the end of our honeymoon. Cartagena is vibrant, safe and comfortable. Cartagena is filled with restaurants of all types and all price ranges. You can find food of any type. There are fancy restaurants and small cafes. The bars stay open late almost every day of the week.</p>
<p>We arrived in Cartagena in the evening so we immediately headed out to get some dinner. We didn&#8217;t feel like walking too far from our hotel so we ate at La Brioche. They serve mid-priced food like pizza, beer and burgers. We each got a pizza and it was very good. I don&#8217;t usually like thin crust but this was perfectly crunchy and seasoned.</p>
<figure id="attachment_393" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-393 size-full" src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_4086_opt-1.jpg" alt="IMG_4086_opt (1)" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_4086_opt-1.jpg 1000w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_4086_opt-1-200x300.jpg 200w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_4086_opt-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_4086_opt-1-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">La Brioche</figcaption></figure>
<p>The first Colombian coffee that Andrew tried in Cartagena was from popular Juan Valdez Cafe. Within the walls of Cartagena, we saw two different locations. The cafe is big with upstairs seating and AC. Besides coffee, Juan Valdez Cafe sells snacks and sandwiches.</p>
<figure id="attachment_397" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-397 size-full" src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2642_opt.jpg" alt="IMG_2642_opt" width="1000" height="750" srcset="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2642_opt.jpg 1000w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2642_opt-300x225.jpg 300w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2642_opt-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Black coffee from Juan Valdez Cafe</figcaption></figure>
<p>Cartagena is very humid so we often found ourselves seeking AC from various eateries. Collage Chaladero was a good find. The menu has lots of appetizers, cocktails and burgers. I snacked on french fries and mozzarella sticks while Andrew ate a lamb burger. The restaurant also features chalkboards at each seat. We had a good laugh writing funny messages to each other while we waited for our food to arrive.</p>

<p>There is lots of Italian food in Cartagena. Andrew and I traveled to Italy in May 2015 so we were very excited to try some more Italian food. Cartagena did not disappoint. Adante Allegro Vivace was so good that we ate their twice during our time in Cartagena. The atmosphere and food are authentic. I highly recommend the Pasta Bolognese. It is one of my favorite dishes and as someone who has eaten it in Bologna, I can say that this was pretty close in quality and taste.</p>

      <h1>Villa Maria Tayrona</h1>
      <p>August 19, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>Our 2nd hotel was located even closer to the Tayrona National Park area. We stayed at Villa Maria Tayrona for 3 nights before heading to Cartagena. The hotel is located up a hill from the street. The rooms are spacious with balconies. It featured a hammock that Andrew took full advantage of. The hotel features an on-site restaurant and direct access to the beach. The restaurant is not included in your hotel fee but they do offer a lot of food options, especially if you like seafood. We ate sandwiches, spaghetti bolognese, and empanadas while staying here. The food is decent but nothing great. Breakfast is the only meal that is included in your hotel fee. They gave us options between toast, pancakes and other breakfast foods. The pancakes were really good!</p>

<p>The hotel grounds are beautiful. There is a draw string bridge and lots of walking trails. The trail to the beach is a bit long, with not a lot of shade. The beach itself is lovely but just like your first hotel, you cannot swim in it due to the high currents. We were lucky enough to snag covered chairs so we spent one day just hanging out on the beach and only going into the water up to our knees. The pool is also a great feature. The water was always warm so you can jump right in. There are lots of comfortable couches and hammocks near the pool area. A whole day can easily be spent lounging by the pool. The waitresses will even bring you food and/or drinks to your seat.</p>

<p>Our room was great. It featured a big balcony that overlooked the jungle. It was perfect for drying our clothes each night. We walked around the grounds and saw other rooms that overlooked the pool and restaurant. I would imagine those rooms to be quite nosy since the pool is open late, as is the restaurant. Our room featured AC and a large ceiling fan so there was never an issue with the heat. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking to relax. There isn&#8217;t much going on in the area besides Tayrona National Park. The hotel doesn&#8217;t offer any excursions but there is a river float excursion that will pick you up at the bottom of the hill (below the hotel).</p>

      <h1>Mendihauca Clearwater Pool</h1>
      <p>August 18, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>We arranged to have a guide take us to the Mendihauca Clearwater pool. It is located not far from Tayrona National Park. Our Spanish-speaking guide Rinaldo picked us up from the hotel and drove us as close to the trail as we could get. Then, we walked for 30 minutes to get to the pool. Along the way, Rinaldo asked us to teach him English words and Andrew was able to use his basic Spanish to talk to our guide. Rinaldo was a great guide; stopping to pick fruit and vegetables along the way. Rinaldo let us know that we were walking on the exact path that the drug cartels had used to transport drugs in the forest. It felt so eerie to imagine how dangerous this trail was not too long ago.</p>

<p>We only saw 2 other groups on the trail and they were both being guided by someone from Colombia. We asked Rinaldo about this and he explained that only indigenous people have access to the Mendihauca Clearwater Pool. He was correct about this because before you can enter the pool area, there is a gate that is locked. Rinaldo had the key! He told us that only certain people are given the key to the pools. When we passed through the gate, we were completely alone. It was just the 3 of us, a waterfall and lots of fish. After changing into our bathing suits, we followed Rinaldo into the pools. It was the most refreshing water I have ever swam in. If you are afraid of fish, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this pool because there were plenty of fish. They left us alone though and swam away when we were near them. We swam all the way to a waterfall and we sat underneath it. Rinaldo showed us up by climbing high up on the rocks and jumping off. We spent about an hour here. As we were leaving, another guided group was entering the area.</p>

<p>The hike back wasn&#8217;t too bad after swimming in the cool water. If you can find a guide, I recommend this 30 minute hike to the pools. The water is a nice reward for hiking in the humid weather. Rinaldo dropped us off at our hotel and thanked us for his &#8220;English lesson.&#8221; Thank you to Rinaldo for helping me get to the waterfall even though I am not that great of a swimmer!</p>

      <h1>Tayrona National Park</h1>
      <p>August 18, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>Our hotel organized a taxi to take us to Tayrona National Park very early. With a packed lunch, we were off to the park. I suggest starting early at the park. It is blazing hot by noon. Upon arrival, you are forced to gather around a small TV that shows a fact-filled video about the park. The video is entirely in Spanish so we didn&#8217;t comprehend one word of it. When the video ends, a man guides you to another line, where you wait to pay for admission into the park (42000 COP). This line took forever. There are 2 windows and the women ask to see your passport or ID before giving you a ticket. We didn&#8217;t bring our passports to the park but she was fine with our ID&#8217;s (even a photo of your passport is acceptable). The woman in the booth sticks a wristband on your arm and you then have to load into a white van filled with other visitors. You pay the driver 3000 COP per person to take you farther into the park where the trail begins. While you can walk the path from the entrance to the trail head, it is LONG. Not only is it long but it&#8217;s very hot and steamy. The van was only a few pesos and I highly recommend it. You will need all the energy you have once you enter the park.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-355 size-full" src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_3921_opt.jpg" alt="IMG_3921_opt" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_3921_opt.jpg 1000w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_3921_opt-300x200.jpg 300w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_3921_opt-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>Once you enter the park, there is one path that eventually takes you all the way to Cabo San Juan. This is a beautiful beach that takes about 2 hours to reach on foot. &#8220;2 hours hiking? No problem!&#8221; Wrong. It is so humid in Colombia. After walking for 15 minutes, you are dripping in sweat. Luckily, most of the path is shaded from the sun but you will still be hot due to the 87% humidity. The scenery is beautiful. You will hike past flowers, horses, monkeys and huge ants carrying leaves. After about 45 minutes of hiking, you will reach the first view-point. Although it was crowded by other tourists, it was a nice place to take a break and finally see the ocean.</p>

<p>There are other beaches along the trail but there will be signs that state you cannot swim in them. In fact, we saw one sign that said how many people have drowned in the water there previously. You will keep walking until you come across the first beach that you can swim in. This is not Cabo San Juan. That, which is about another 30-45 minutes ahead. The first beach is such a relief. By the time you reach this beach, you will be covered in sweat and dirt. We jumped right into the water and the water temperature was perfect. The beach is very busy but that is to be expected with the heat.</p>

<p>After spending about an hour at the first beach, we kept walking towards Cabo San Juan. You will come across another beach but we decided not to stop there. After passing horses and monkeys, we finally reached Cabo San Juan. You will see a long line of people waiting for something. They are waiting to figure out their camping situations. We weren&#8217;t camping in the park so we ignored the line. You will pass a packed restaurant. Keep walking and you will immediately be stunned by the beauty of Cabo San Juan.</p>

<p>The water was perfect at Cabo San Juan. We spent a lot of time just letting the waves wash over us. The water is calm here but it gets deep fast. If you are scared of fish, I probably wouldn&#8217;t recommend this beach. Fish were swimming around us and one other tourist even had a fish run into her leg. After spending over an hour at Cabo San Juan, we decided to start the 2 hour trek back to the park entrance. Our hotel arranged for a taxi to pick us up at a specific time. The walk back was one of the most tiring hikes I have ever done. Not only are you hot but you have been swimming in the sun all day. At one point, my legs were propelling my body forward but I have no idea how! On the way back, we found a rock formation that you can climb to see a beautiful view of the mountains and ocean meeting together.</p>

<p>I felt like I won an Olympic medal by the time we reached the white van that was going to drive us to the park entrance. Again, you pay the driver 3000 COP per person to take you back to where you entered. I would highly recommend a day at Tayrona National Park. A lot of people camped there and that is probably less tiring since you would have more time to see the park. You can reach Cabo San Juan in 1 day but be warned that you will be more tired than ever. We fell asleep on the way from the park back to our hotel. I couldn&#8217;t even keep my eyes open at dinner that night. Tayrona National Park is beautiful and adventurous. Although it was tiring, I felt so accomplished and fit after completing the hike.</p>
