      <h1>3D Museum</h1>
      <p>April 16, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>After our stay on the Dragon Legend cruise, we stayed another night in a hotel near Halong Bay. The hotel was called Royal Lotus hotel and I would highly recommend it. The staff was friendly and the room was spacious.</p>
<p>We were in the area during off season so there really wasn&#8217;t many people around. We explored the surrounding area of the hotel and all we could find was a night market and a dead mall. Or so we thought! Located inside this mall is a 3D museum. I imagine this place to be completely packed during the summer but when we went, we were the only ones there!</p>
<p>The museum is huge, spanning 2 seperate buildings. There are 3D paintings that you become apart of. Since we were the only customers, an employee decided to be our personal tour guide and photographer. She helped us pose for every photo and insisted on us taking photos together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrew and I had so much fun running around this place! I Imagine it to be less enjoyable when its very busy but we got so lucky!</p>

      <h1>Halong Bay</h1>
      <p>April 14, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>After Cambodia, Andrew and I took a 4 hour shuttle bus to Halong Bay. We had a 1 night Junk cruise booked. A junk boat is what the cruise ships are called at Halong Bay. They are not junky at all. The day before we departed, we received an email letting us know that we had been upgraded to a more luxury cruise!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We arrived at the Halong harbor with throngs of other tourists waiting to embark on their overnight cruises. Our boat was called &#8220;Dragon Legend.&#8221; This was my first time on a cruise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9487-1.jpg"><img src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9487-1.jpg" alt=""></a>&nbsp;<br />
It was such a beautiful experience. Halong Bay is filled with massive limestone rocks that jet out from the water like icebergs. A junk cruise is the best way to get up close to them. We sailed through the rocks during sunset. I was stunned by the natural beauty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9529.jpg"><img src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9529.jpg" alt=""></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

The crew on board was wonderful! They made sure to remember our food allergies whenever food was being served. It was great to meet other tourists from all over the world. We spoke to people from Australia, Spain, England and even Argentina.</p>
<p>You can also kayak, swim and explore a nearby cave. A junk cruise when visiting Halong Bay is a must!</p>

      <h1>Community Tourism</h1>
      <p>April 14, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>After exploring the Banteay Srei temple, we walked further and found a group of locals who offer canoe rides on a lake. After paying $12 USD for 3 of us, we got on a boat with our guide. This turned out to be one of my favorite experiences in Cambodia!</p>
<p>Our guide spoke broken English but was very interested in our lives. He asked about California and he mentioned liking Obama. He let us know that he is 23 years old and desperately wants to attend University. Unfortuntely, school is simply too expensive in Cambodia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9442.jpg"><img src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9442.jpg" alt=""></a>&nbsp;<br />
He also spoke about wanting to get married but being unable to afford the costs associated with a wedding. He was pleased to find out that Andrew and I will wed in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ride was soothing and very eye opening. It was amazing to see the beautiful lake and lily pads. I will never forget this unique experience. We were all pleased to know our money goes directly to the locals, who run the small boat service. There was not another tourist in sight! That really added to the quiet landscape.</p>

      <h1>Banteay Srei</h1>
      <p>April 13, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>On our last day in Cambodia, we visited a Hindu Temple located 22 miles from our apartment. We took a tuk tuk there. It was so great to see more of Cambodia while listening to our ipods on the 1 hour long tuk tuk ride. We arrived at the temple with lots of other tourists. The temple is still located within the Angkor Wat park.</p>
<p>This particular temple was the most intricate temple of our trip. The carvings are so well preserved!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9420.jpg"><img src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9420.jpg" alt=""></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

The temple area has a botanical garden, roaming water buffalo and many view points. Although this temple is farther away from town, it is totally worth the trek.</p>

      <h1>Pub Street</h1>
      <p>April 13, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>After another long day of visiting temples, we decided to visit the much talked about Pub Street. Luckily, it was walking distance from our hotel. Pub Street is a few blocks of various bars and restaurants. I had heard mixed reviews from friends who has visited before us.</p>
<p>We ate dinner on Pub Street and it was the most expensive meal of our trip. We didn&#8217;t order anything fancy but I suppose Pub Street is catered towards tourists. After dinner, we walked up and down Pub Street to see what all the hype was about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have much to say about it because it was SUCH a dumb tourist trap. It was filled with large groups of men, just walking up and down. There was loud music blasting from all directions. Locals were charging tourists 50 cents to take photos of cooked beetles and spiders. There really wasn&#8217;t much going on!</p>
<p>Maybe I was there on an off night but Pub Street was not for me. We didn&#8217;t stay long and instead, wandered off to another night market that ended up being a lot more entertaining.</p>

      <div class="content"><p>I met Natalie the first week of my freshman year of college. We lived across the hall from each other. That was 8 years ago. Today, we live on opposite sides of the world but she is still one of my best friends. In fact, she is a bridesmaid in my wedding this summer!</p>
<p>Natalie is currently a teacher in Hanoi, Vietnam. Her apartment is located a few blocks from Hanoi&#8217;s old quarter. Natalie also traveled to Cambodia with me. I am so happy to have these new memories with my best friend.</p>
<p>Our significant other&#8217;s tease us that we talk the same. We do! Natalie and I have all the same interests. Sometimes when we talk to each other, people don&#8217;t know what we are saying. Valley girls for life.&nbsp;</p>

At almost every temple we visited over our 3 day trip to the Angkor Wat park, we were greeted by victims of landmines. They sit at the entrance of the temples and play beautiful music for donations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of them had a missing leg or arm. We donated to these groups at various temples. It was crazy to see these local people playing music after suffering such a tragic accident.</p>
<p>Enjoy the short video!</p>

      <h1>Siem Reap Night Market</h1>
      <p>April 10, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>Our hotel in Cambodia was located a short walk from a bustling night market. After a long day at the temples, we mustered up the energy to explore the market. I am glad we did! I absolutely loved it.</p>
<p>In Cambodia, you can haggle with any shop owner. I was able to purchase many souvenirs and gifts for my friends and family.</p>
<p>The market sold everything from clothing, jewelry, food and various trinkets. Cambodia uses the US dollar. I don&#8217;t think I purchased anything over $3 at the night market.</p>
<p>I would recommend a quick visit here if you have a free night in Siem Reap, Cambodia. The locals were very friendly and they love to ask where you are from. It was great talking to them while browsing their shops.&nbsp;</p>

      <h1>Angkor Wat</h1>
      <p>April 10, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>Angkor Wat is a HUGE temple complex located near Siem Reap, Cambodia. After seeing countless postcards and documentaries about these temples, I was grateful to visit myself. The complex is the largest religious site in the world (1,626,000 sq meters).</p>
<p>The most popular temple is also named Angkor Wat but there are countless temples to be seen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After watching the sunrise at Angkor Wat, we explored the temple further. It is a beautiful place, filled with intricate designs. Even though there are countless tourists touring the temple, you still feel at peace.</p>

      <h1>Sunrise at Angkor Wat</h1>
      <p>April 10, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>We woke up at 4:30 am to catch the sunrise over Angkor Wat in Cambodia! It was our first full day in Siem Reap, Cambodia. The hotel packed us a breakfast to go and our tuk tuk driver for the weekend, Mr. Samat, picked us up. After purchasing a $40 3- day pass to the Angkor Wat park, we raced to the sunrise.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at Angkor Wat, we were greeted by hundreds of other tourists who wanted to see the epic sunrise. After waiting for about 30 minutes, the fiery orange sun began to rise. It reflected in the water around us. It was truly a moment I will never forget. Even though I was extremely tired, I don&#8217;t regret it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a very humbling and awe inspiring experience. I was also happy to be there with my best friend Natalie and my fiance Andrew.</p>
<p>Ps. It is VERY hot in Cambodia so by the time the sun rises, it is already about 85 degrees!&nbsp;</p>

      <h1>First motorbike experience</h1>
      <p>April 09, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>Almost everyone in Hanoi, Vietnam rides a motorbike. There are even motorbike taxis. After watching the locals for a day, we had to experience it for ourselves.</p>
<p>It was such a rush of adrenaline. It is also surprisingly safe! I can&#8217;t wait to do it again one day.</p>
<p>We stopped at a beautiful cathedral on the way too! I would highly recommend a motorbike experience in Hanoi!&nbsp;</p>

      <div class="content"><p>My friend Natalie took us to the local Bia Hoi for dinner and drinks. The Bia Hoi specializes in daily beer that costs about 10 cents a glass. The beer is made daily and has a shelf life of 24 hours. It was such an authentic Vietnamese experience! We also ate very well for quite inexpensive.</p>

      <div class="content"><p>What a sight! Ho Chi Minh was the leader of Vietnam until he died in 1969. Although he led a simple life, he ended up being buried in a giant mausoleum.

<p>I was mesmerized by the lake upon first glance. It was so fun to see famalies with their small children, strolling the lake and relaxing. It is defintely a much needed oasis in Hanoi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Almost everyone here rides a motorbike and there are no real traffic laws. You just cross the street and the motorbikes simply go around you. It is crazy the first few times you cross the street but it gets easier.</p>

      <div class="content"><p>Although I woke up jet lagged, we managed to walk over 5 miles throughout the city. Hanoi is unconventially beautiful! The buildings are old and covered in ivy. We exchanged our currency today &amp; got local sim cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After breakfast, we went to a neighborhood that is divided by active trail tracks. Whenever the train comes by, the people who reside there must quickly move all their belongings inside. It was an incredible experience exploring the train tracks and peering into the small homes. Everyone we encountered was friendly!</p>

      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p>April 02, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>Hello. My name is Sigournee and I have decided to document my travels. Andrew is my fiance and you will see a lot of him on this blog too! Andrew and I have bonded over our love of music, pizza and adventure. We reside in Los Angeles. <strong>Tomorrow we embark on our biggest trip yet; we are headed to Vietnam &amp; Cambodia. </strong>We love to travel together! In fact, we have traveled with each other many times before!</p>
<p>Our first trip together was to San Francisco in 2010. As two 20 year olds from San Diego, trekking to San Francisco was a big deal. My cousin Zach and his then girlfriend (now wife) Lindsay, let us stay at there apartment. It was in Hayes Valley so we ate so much good food that weekend. I recommend Patxi&#8217;s Pizza whenever anyone is visiting San Francisco. It&#8217;s a must! We also managed to unknowingly arrive in the city as Gay Pride was starting. We had no idea it was even taking place that weekend!</p>

<p>We traveled to Portland in 2014. We ate a lot of food. Andrew drank a lot of beer. It was a great time, mostly because you can play slot machines in bars! My best friend Audra lives there so we stayed with her.</p>

<p>Our most memorable trip happened May 2015. We backpacked Italy for 2 weeks. We went to Rome, Florence, Bologna, Venice, &amp; Cinque Terre. Everything we ate was delicious. Italy is a beautiful country and I hope to go back one day! Trastevere in Rome was Andrew and I&#8217;s absolute favorite part of the city. We had a long layover in Dusseldorf, Germany on the way back to the USA. Dusseldorf is a very nice city. So clean!</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t forget Alaska. We spent a week there in July 2015. My family and I stayed in Anchorage and we absolutely loved it. Alaska is so naturally stunning. Also, the sun didn&#8217;t really set so that was pretty crazy. I would definitely go back to Alaska one day!</p>
