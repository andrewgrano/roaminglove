After paying $12 USD for 3 of us, we got on a boat with our guide. This turned out to be one of my favorite experiences in Cambodia!</p>
<p>Our guide spoke broken English but was very interested in our lives. He asked about California and he mentioned liking Obama. He let us know that he is 23 years old and desperately wants to attend University. Unfortuntely, school is simply too expensive in Cambodia.&nbsp;</p>

He also spoke about wanting to get married but being unable to afford the costs associated with a wedding. He was pleased to find out that Andrew and I will wed in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ride was soothing and very eye opening. It was amazing to see the beautiful lake and lily pads. I will never forget this unique experience. We were all pleased to know our money goes directly to the locals, who run the small boat service. There was not another tourist in sight! That really added to the quiet landscape.</p>
