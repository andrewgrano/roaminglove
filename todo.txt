TO DO

- build contribute form
- google pagespeedinsights - various improvements
- mask email address via mailgun
- minified CSS and JS
- add sitemap & other SEO improvements
- contribute form: remember users typed entries on-refresh (cookies? jquery cookies?)
- email blast
- LONGSHOT: at the end of an article, add section for "on this trip, I also went to...". Similar to bottom of this article: https://scotch.io/bar-talk/the-complete-visual-guide-to-sublime-text-3-themes-color-schemes-and-cool-features
- postWidget__categories: vertical line has cross-browser issues
- 301 redirects for posts that have had their title changed (also check disqus url)
- replace admin front-end (www.adminroaminglove.com) with "coming soon" page
