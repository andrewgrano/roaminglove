A junk boat is what the cruise ships are called at Halong Bay. They are not junky at all. The day before we departed, we received an email letting us know that we had been upgraded to a more luxury cruise!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We arrived at the Halong harbor with throngs of other tourists waiting to embark on their overnight cruises. Our boat was called &#8220;Dragon Legend.&#8221; This was my first time on a cruise.</p>

It was such a beautiful experience. Halong Bay is filled with massive limestone rocks that jet out from the water like icebergs. A junk cruise is the best way to get up close to them. We sailed through the rocks during sunset. I was stunned by the natural beauty.</p>

The crew on board was wonderful! They made sure to remember our food allergies whenever food was being served. It was great to meet other tourists from all over the world. We spoke to people from Australia, Spain, England and even Argentina.</p>
<p>You can also kayak, swim and explore a nearby cave. A junk cruise when visiting Halong Bay is a must!</p>
