Luckily, it was walking distance from our hotel. Pub Street is a few blocks of various bars and restaurants. I had heard mixed reviews from friends who has visited before us.</p>
<p>We ate dinner on Pub Street and it was the most expensive meal of our trip. We didn&#8217;t order anything fancy but I suppose Pub Street is catered towards tourists. After dinner, we walked up and down Pub Street to see what all the hype was about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have much to say about it because it was SUCH a dumb tourist trap. It was filled with large groups of men, just walking up and down. There was loud music blasting from all directions. Locals were charging tourists 50 cents to take photos of cooked beetles and spiders. There really wasn&#8217;t much going on!</p>
<p>Maybe I was there on an off night but Pub Street was not for me. We didn&#8217;t stay long and instead, wandered off to another night market that ended up being a lot more entertaining.</p>
