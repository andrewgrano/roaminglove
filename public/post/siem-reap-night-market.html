After a long day at the temples, we mustered up the energy to explore the market. I am glad we did! I absolutely loved it.</p>
<p>In Cambodia, you can haggle with any shop owner. I was able to purchase many souvenirs and gifts for my friends and family.</p>
<p>The market sold everything from clothing, jewelry, food and various trinkets. Cambodia uses the US dollar. I don&#8217;t think I purchased anything over $3 at the night market.</p>
<p>I would recommend a quick visit here if you have a free night in Siem Reap, Cambodia. The locals were very friendly and they love to ask where you are from. It was great talking to them while browsing their shops.&nbsp;</p>
