        <div class="content"><p>The Lost City of Petra. First thing people think of? Indiana Jones! It&#8217;s true. I thought about it for a second while I was there but, mostly I just got lost in how huge and amazing this place was. You always see pictures of the Treasury in Petra so I thought that was pretty much all it was but, there is so much more to it than that. Petra is HUGE!!! We didn&#8217;t even get to see it all in the time that we were there. We did however get some unique experiences.</p>
<p>When you first enter, it&#8217;s a mile or so before you actually get to the main site in Petra (which is the treasury). They try to get you to get in a horse and buggy but we wanted to walk. It was a beautiful walk, so I didn&#8217;t mind. Then after that walk, you turn a corner and BAM! There is the treasury. It&#8217;s amazing and you KNOW why it is one of the 7 wonders of the world. I could just sit and stare at the Treasury all day (especially with those cute camels in front) but there is so much more to see!</p>

<p>We continued walking through Petra. We had seen pictures from the treasury from above, so we wanted to hike to get that view, so we were on a mission to find it. While we were walking, we were getting pestered to pay for donkey rides to get around Petra faster to see more. It makes sense, but we were tired of being bugged, so we said &#8220;no&#8221; to everyone that offered a donkey. We kept walking and saw some beautiful sites while we walked. ​We found the pathway that lead to the view of the Treasury that we wanted so ,we started the hike up. It was good to get some exercise in since I had taken a couple weeks off of the gym. Can&#8217;t beat that view!</p>

<p>When we finally made it all the way up and found our way to the view that we were looking for, we were not expecting anything to be up there. However, there was a tent. It was awesome. It was a tent with cushions inside so that you could sit back and relax while you enjoyed the view. You could even buy some tea from a Bedouin that was there in the tent. He also played music for us. For while, it was just Deb and I in the tent and it felt like it was just for us. It was amazing. We hung out there for a while.</p>

<p>We decided to head back down before it got dark and we wanted to find a great place to watch the sunset. When we hiked all the way back down, we ran into these 2 guys on donkey&#8217;s. Of course they were wanting us to pay to go on a donkey ride somewhere. We said no. However, we asked them where a good place to watch the sunset would be. They said they would take us on their donkey&#8217;s. We said we weren&#8217;t going to pay and they said they didn&#8217;t want us to pay, they just wanted to take us. So we both got on a donkey and they led us to a spot to watch the sunset. It was beautiful. While we sat and enjoyed the view, they started talking to us and after a little while, they invited us to have tea with them in one of their caves. So off we went to his cave! What a cool cave. The other guy made tea for all of us and we sat in the cave for about an hour and chatted while we drank tea. Then it was dark out and it was time to go. Since it was dark, they shared the donkey with us on the way out, which wasn&#8217;t the most comfortable, but it is what it is. By the time we got to the gate, they had a taxi waiting for us to take us back to our hostel.</p>

<p>After dinner at our hostel, we went back to Petra to see Petra by night. It was freezing and I didn&#8217;t bring anything warmer than my jacket. The guy telling everyone where to go saw how cold I was and he asked me if he got me a coat to borrow, would I promise not to get it dirty. I told him I swore on my life and I would love him forever. He laughed and then snuck over to a shop that was still open that had a Bedouin coat hanging on a hanger outside the shop. He looked around to make sure nobody was looking and then stole the coat from the shop and gave it to me. I laughed and felt bad and was thankful all at the same time. I promised him I would bring it back and he said he just wanted me to enjoy the experience. Those Bedouin coats are very warm. We made our way to the treasury for the ceremony. The entire walk there was lit by tea light bags. It was magical. When we got to the treasury, there were cushions for us to sit on and we sat in silence and they served us tea while we sat and listened to beautiful music while Petra was lit by tea light bags. It was lovely and I am so glad we went.</p>
<p>Needless to see, Petra was a pretty awesome experience. No regrets! It&#8217;s a must see. It&#8217;s one of my favorite wonders so far. In fact, it&#8217;s up there with Machu Picchu.</p>
