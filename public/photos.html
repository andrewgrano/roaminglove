      <h1>Villa Maria Tayrona</h1>
      <p>August 19, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>Our 2nd hotel was located even closer to the Tayrona National Park area. We stayed at Villa Maria Tayrona for 3 nights before heading to Cartagena. The hotel is located up a hill from the street. The rooms are spacious with balconies. It featured a hammock that Andrew took full advantage of. The hotel features an on-site restaurant and direct access to the beach. The restaurant is not included in your hotel fee but they do offer a lot of food options, especially if you like seafood. We ate sandwiches, spaghetti bolognese, and empanadas while staying here. The food is decent but nothing great. Breakfast is the only meal that is included in your hotel fee. They gave us options between toast, pancakes and other breakfast foods. The pancakes were really good!</p>

<p>The hotel grounds are beautiful. There is a draw string bridge and lots of walking trails. The trail to the beach is a bit long, with not a lot of shade. The beach itself is lovely but again, you cannot swim in it due to the high currents. We were lucky enough to snag covered chairs so we spent one day just hanging out on the beach and only going into the water up to our knees. The pool is also a great feature. The water was always warm so you can jump right in. There are lots of comfortable couches and hammocks near the pool area. A whole day can easily be spent lounging by the pool. The waitresses will even bring you food and/or drinks to your seat.</p>

<p>Our room was great. It featured a big balcony that was perfect for drying our clothes each night. Our room featured a balcony that overlooked the jungle. We walked around the grounds and saw other rooms that overlooked the pool and restaurant. I would imagine those rooms to be quite nosy since the pool is open late, as is the restaurant. Our room featured AC and a large ceiling fan so there was never an issue with the heat. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking to relax. There isn&#8217;t much going on in the area besides Tayrona National Park. The hotel doesn&#8217;t offer any excursions but there is a river float excursion that will pick you up at the bottom of the hill (below the hotel).</p>

      <h1>Mendihauca Clearwater Pool</h1>
      <p>August 18, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>We arranged to have a guide take us to the Mendihauca Clearwater pool. It is located not far from Tayrona National Park. Our Spanish-speaking guide Rinaldo picked us up from the hotel and drove us as close to the trail as we could get. Then, we walked for 30 minutes to get to the pool. Along the way, Rinaldo asked us to teach him English words and Andrew was able to use his basic Spanish to talk to our guide. Rinaldo was a great guide; stopping to pick fruit and vegetables along the way. Rinaldo let us know that we were walking on the exact path that the drug cartels had used to transport drugs in the forest. It felt so eerie to imagine how dangerous this trail was not too long ago.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-374" src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2466_opt.jpg" alt="IMG_2466_opt" width="1000" height="750" srcset="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2466_opt.jpg 1000w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2466_opt-300x225.jpg 300w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2466_opt-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>

<p>We only saw 2 other groups on the trail and they were both being guided by someone from Colombia. We asked Rinaldo about this and he explained that only indigenous people have access to the Mendihauca Clearwater Pool. He was correct about this because before you can enter the pool area, there is a gate that is locked. Rinaldo had the key! He told us that only certain people are given the key to the pools. When we passed through the gate, we were completely alone. It was just the 3 of us, a waterfall and lots of fish. After changing into our bathing suits, we followed Rinaldo into the pools. It was the most refreshing water I have ever swam in. Again, if you are afraid of fish, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this pool because there were plenty of fish. They left us alone though and swam away when we were near them. We swam all the way to a waterfall and we sat underneath it. Rinaldo showed us up by climbing up above the pool and jumping off of the rocks. We spent about an hour here. As we were leaving, another guide group was entering the area.</p>

<p>The hike back wasn&#8217;t too bad after swimming in the cool water. If you can find a guide, I recommend this 30 minute hike to the pools. The water is a nice reward for hiking in the humid weather. Rinaldo dropped us off at our hotel and thanked us for his &#8220;English lesson.&#8221; Thank you to Rinaldo for helping me get to the waterfall even though I am not that great of a swimmer.</p>

      <h1>Tayrona National Park</h1>
      <p>August 18, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>We organized with our hotel to have a taxi take us to Tayrona National Park very early in the morning. With a packed lunch, we were off to the park. Upon arrival, you are forced to gather around a small TV that shows a fact filled video about the park. The video is entirely in Spanish didn&#8217;t comprehend one word of it. When the video ends, a man guides you to another line, were you wait to pay for admission into the park. This line took forever. There are 2 windows and the women ask to see your passport or ID before giving you a ticket. We didn&#8217;t bring our passports to the park but she was fine with our ID&#8217;s. The hotel told us that even a photo of your passport is acceptable. They stick a wristband on your arm and you then have to load into a white van filled with other visitors. You pay the driver to take you in the park. While you can walk the path from the entrance to trail head, it is LONG. Not only is it long but it&#8217;s very hot and steamy. The van was only a few pesos and I highly recommend it. Do not walk to the trail head. You will need all the energy you have once you enter the park.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-355 size-full" src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_3921_opt.jpg" alt="IMG_3921_opt" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_3921_opt.jpg 1000w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_3921_opt-300x200.jpg 300w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_3921_opt-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>Once you enter the park, there is one path that eventually takes you all the way to Cabo San Juan. This is a beautiful beach that takes about 2 hours to reach on foot. 2 hours hiking? No problem! Wrong. It is so humid in Colombia. After walking for 15 minutes, you are dripping in sweat. Luckily, most of the path is shaded from the sun but you will still be hot due to the 87% humidity. The scenery is beautiful. You will hike past flowers, horses, monkeys and huge ants carrying leaves. After about 45 minutes of hiking, you will reach the first view-point. Although it was crowded by other tourists, it was a nice place to take a break and finally see the ocean.</p>

<p>You will keep walking until you come across the first beach that you can swim in. This is not Cabo San Juan. That is about another 30-45 minutes ahead. There are other beaches along the trail but there will be signs that state you cannot swim in them. In fact, we saw one sign that said how many people have drowned in the water there previously. The first beach is such a relief. By the time you reach the first beach, you will be covered in sweat and dirt. We jumped right into the water and the water temperature was perfect. The beach is very busy but that is to be expected with the heat.</p>

<p>After spending about an hour at the first beach, we kept walking towards Cabo San Juan. You will come across another beach but we decided not to stop there. After passing horses and monkeys, we finally reached Cabo San Juan. You will see a long line of people waiting for something. They are waiting to figure out their camping situations. We weren&#8217;t camping in the park so we ignored the line. You will pass a packed restaurant. Keep walking and you will immediately be stunned by the beauty of Cabo San Juan.</p>

<p>The water was perfect at Cabo San Juan. We spent a lot of time just letting the waves wash over us. The water is calm here but it gets deep fast. If you are scared of fish, I probably wouldn&#8217;t recommend this beach. Fish were swimming around us and one other tourist even had a fish run into her leg. After spending over an hour at Cabo San Juan, we decided to start the 2 hour trek back to the park entrance. Our hotel arranged for a taxi to pick us up at a specific time. The walk back was one of the most tiring hikes I have ever done. Not only are you hot but you have been swimming in the sun all day. At one point, my legs were propelling my body forward but I have no idea how. On the way back, we find a rock formation that you can climb and see a beautiful view of the mountains and ocean meeting together.</p>

<p>I felt like I won an Olympic medal by the time we reached the white van that was going to drive us to the park entrance. Again, you pay the driver a few pesos to take you back to where you entered. I would highly recommend a day at Tayrona National Park. A lot of people camped there and that is probably less tiring since you would have more time to see the park. You can reach Cabo San Juan in 1 day but be warned that you will be more tired than ever. We fell asleep on the way from the park back to our hotel. I couldn&#8217;t even keep my eyes open at dinner that night. Tayrona National Park is beautiful and adventurous. Although it was tiring, I felt so accomplished and fit after completing the hike.</p>

      <h1>Gitana Del Mar Boutique Beach Resort</h1>
      <p>August 16, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>We booked 3 different hotels for our honeymoon in Colombia. After a 4 hour drive from Cartagena, we arrived at Gitana Del Mar. We arrived at dusk so I was eager to explore the next morning. Adriana, who checked us in and worked with us to arrange daily activities, showed us all around the hotel as soon as we arrived. Even though we arrived at night, the chef on site made us a delicious teriyaki chicken meal with rice and a raspberry brownie for dessert. The chef makes dinner for all of the hotel guests. There is one set meal for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We let the hotel know of our food allergies before arriving. The chef and staff made sure to accommodate our allergies with every meal they served us.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-333 size-full" src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2461_opt-1.jpg" alt="IMG_2461_opt" width="900" height="1200" srcset="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2461_opt-1.jpg 900w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2461_opt-1-225x300.jpg 225w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2461_opt-1-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>The next morning, we woke up and ate breakfast at the hotel. I was able to snap a few photos in the daytime but we were off to Tayrona National Park. Our hotel arranged a taxi driver to take us and another couple to the park. It was great having the hotel sort out taxis for us. None of the drivers we encountered spoke any English. After a tiring day at the park, it was so relaxing to come back to our room. The room is a bungalow, situated about a 3 minute walk to the beach. The hotel has direct access to a very secluded beach with intense currents. You cannot swim in this water unless you are very familiar with swimming against high currents. The waves were massive and I never once saw anyone in the ocean here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-334 size-full" src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2441_opt-1.jpg" alt="IMG_2441_opt" width="1000" height="743" srcset="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2441_opt-1.jpg 1000w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2441_opt-1-300x223.jpg 300w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2441_opt-1-768x571.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-335 size-full" src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2442_opt-1.jpg" alt="IMG_2442_opt" width="1000" height="750" srcset="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2442_opt-1.jpg 1000w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2442_opt-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2442_opt-1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>The room featured a queen size bed, a twin bed/daybed and an outdoor bathroom. The room was the perfect size and we used the daybed to sort out our luggage and get packed for daily adventures. I have never used an outdoor bathroom before. The toilet, sink and shower were all outdoors. There is no hot water at this hotel so you have a cold shower waiting for you each night. Luckily, the weather never seemed to drop below 80 degrees Fahrenheit so once you got used to the water, the shower was pretty enjoyable. It was also a nice change to shower among palm trees and flowers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, if you are really afraid of bugs, I would not recommend this hotel. We had to battle crickets, mosquitoes and jumping spiders. Shout out to the maintenance man who got a JUMPING SPIDER out of our room at 11 pm at night. You will also always have small ants in your room. It wasn&#8217;t too much of an issue but you definitely have to remember to close all your bags at nighttime. Andrew is pretty afraid of bugs so it was good we were only staying for 3 nights at this hotel. I would also not recommend this hotel if you are afraid of dogs. There are 2 dogs that live onsite but they are very tame and friendly. They will come up to you and hang out with you during meals. I am not a dog lover but these dogs didn&#8217;t bother me! They followed us out to the beach one day and just laid next to us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entire staff at Gitana Del Mar is wonderful. I became very ill one day from some bad ice water I drank while staying there. The staff MORE than assisted me with a speedy recovery. They brought me tea to my room. They made special food for me to eat. They repeatedly asked Andrew how I was feeling. I have never felt so taken care of by any staff at any hotel. Although being sick for a day was terrible, I was in the right place! Thank you AGAIN to the entire staff of Gitana Del Mar. I will always remember all of you for helping me recover from a nasty stomach illness.</p>
<p>I recommend this hotel to any couple looking for remoteness. You will only hear birds, monkeys and ocean waves while sleeping. It was very peaceful waking up to the sound of birds chirping just outside your window. The hotel offers many day trips and the food is delicious. You will find a number of hammocks and shaded daybeds to relax on, too. We laid on a daybed outside during a rainstorm. It was a tranquil way to enjoy the rain. Thank you, Gitana Del Mar! Shout out to Adriana for being a beautiful person. Your advice about setting intentions will stay with me always.</p>

      <h1>Landing in Cartagena</h1>
      <p>August 15, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>Upon arriving in Cartagena, we were headed to our first hotel located near the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. We wanted to stay near Tayrona National Park so we could get there early in the mornings. We arranged a taxi through our hotel. The driver was waiting for us as soon as we landed in Cartagena. We loaded up the car and started the 4 hour drive to our first hotel. The drive was pleasant but definitely felt long. At one point, we got stuck in a traffic jam that lasted for 45 minutes. No cars could move so people started getting out of their vehicles and began hanging out in the street. We did as the locals did!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-329 size-full" src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2309_opt.jpg" alt="IMG_2309_opt" width="1000" height="750" srcset="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2309_opt.jpg 1000w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2309_opt-300x225.jpg 300w, http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2309_opt-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>Our driver was nice enough to stop along the way so that Andrew could get a Colombian sim card. We do not speak much Spanish so this would have been difficult without his guidance. There are plenty of rest stops along the way so it was no problem using the restroom or getting more snacks. I enjoyed observing Colombia via car during this drive.</p>

      <h1>Honeymoon: Colombia</h1>
      <p>August 15, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>Andrew and I got married on June 25th, 2016 in San Diego, California. It was the best day of our lives and we are still in disbelief that we are married to each other. Due to the amount of time that goes into wedding planning, we waited till April to book our honeymoon. In fact, we hadn&#8217;t even decided on a honeymoon destination until mid-April. It was very unlike me to book a trip only 4 months before departing but I had no choice. I was drowning in wedding duties and the last thing on my mind was travel. I was too concerned with my wedding dress fitting me.</p>

<p>If you had asked me 5 years ago where I was going to honeymoon, I would have said &#8220;Paris, France&#8221; without hesitation. Even as a little girl, I wanted to visit Paris with my future &#8220;prince&#8221; one day. When Andrew asked me where I wanted to honeymoon, I surprised myself by not wanting to go to Paris anymore. It suddenly just felt too easy and too crowded. Our last trip in April was to Vietnam and Cambodia. I was still craving culture shock and adventure. I told Andrew the following, &#8220;I want to go somewhere that has warm ocean water but is close to a city to explore. I don&#8217;t want to go to Hawaii or the Caribbean or Mexico.&#8221; I have already been to Hawaii and I have been to Jamaica on two family trips. Mexico seemed to close to home. Andrew came back to after some research and said, &#8220;Cartagena, Colombia.&#8221; The planning began immediately!</p>
<p>Neither of us had been to Colombia or South America before. Cartagena looked so dreamy with its colorful buildings and horse-drawn carriages. We decided to stick to the coast of Colombia; making our way from Tayrona National Park to Cartagena. We gave ourselves 12 days for our Honeymoon.</p>
<p>The next series of posts will be about my experience in Colombia. I will review hotels, treks, parks, beaches and of course, Cartagena. Enjoy!</p>

      <h1>Vietnam and Cambodia: Recap</h1>
      <p>April 18, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>Andrew and I made it safely back to Los Angeles after a 20 hour day of travel. 12 hours after landing, I got sick with a cold. I&#8217;m still recovering from a sore throat now. I can only say I am happy to be sick in my own bed than on an airplane or in a foreign country!</p>
<p>Visiting Southeast Asia was a life changing trip. For the longest time, I never imagined myself exploring Asia. I wanted to visit Europe so badly. After my trip to Italy, I suddenly became interested in other parts of the world. I am glad my curiosity led me to Vietnam and Cambodia. The people of Vietnam and Cambodia were nothing but gracious. I never once felt discriminated against in either country.</p>
<p>My favorite things about Vietnam:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motorbike rides through Hanoi &#8211; Cheap and safe but mostly, very exhilarating</li>
<li>Deep fried pork ribs &#8211; I ate these at the Bia Hoi and I would eat them again</li>
<li>The Old Quarter  &#8211; So much to see and great bargain shopping. You can haggle with almost every shop owner for a better deal.</li>
<li>Cheap taxi and Uber rides &#8211; We didn&#8217;t take a ride over $5 USD our entire time in Hanoi</li>
<li>How kind and honest the people are &#8211; They help you convert your currency without ripping you off. It took some time to get used to the Dong bills but it was nice to know that the Vietnamese people only want to help you</li>
<li>Meeting people from around the world &#8211; From random bars to our Dragon Legend junk cruise, you are constantly meeting people from all parts of the world</li>
</ul>
<p>My favorite things about Cambodia:</p>
<ul>
<li>How affordable a 4 star hotel is ($55 for Diamond D’Angkor Boutique: http://www.diamondangkor.com/) This is where we stayed and I would highly recommend it. The rooms are large and the staff are more than accommodating. They organized all of our tuk tuk rides to and from the temples. They even gave us a to-go breakfast when we wanted to see the sunrise at 5:30 am at Angkor Wat!</li>
<li>Angkor Archaeological Park &#8211; After 3 days of temple hopping, it wasn&#8217;t near enough time for this park. Although the heat was suffocating, I would recommend everyone make the trek to Angkor Park one day</li>
<li>How innocent the children are &#8211; Riding on a tuk tuk through Cambodia allowed me to see lots of small children running around. It was the first time in a long time that I saw kids being kids. No cell phones, iPods or laptops. They were playing with toys and small water guns. They were chasing each other and laughing. It was a beautiful sight!</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t know when I will visit Asia again but I know I want to go back. After being there, I realized I wanted to explore more Asian countries. I want to visit Japan soon!</p>
<p><strong>Where to next? </strong>Well, Andrew and I have given ourselves till May 1st to book our honeymoon. We think we know where we are going but I won&#8217;t give it away yet!!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading about my trip to Vietnam &amp; Cambodia! I really enjoyed blogging and I will be doing it again for my next trip.</p>

      <h1>3D Museum</h1>
      <p>April 16, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>After our stay on the Dragon Legend cruise, we stayed another night in a hotel near Halong Bay. The hotel was called Royal Lotus hotel and I would highly recommend it. The staff was friendly and the room was spacious.</p>
<p>We were in the area during off season so there really wasn&#8217;t many people around. We explored the surrounding area of the hotel and all we could find was a night market and a dead mall. Or so we thought! Located inside this mall is a 3D museum. I imagine this place to be completely packed during the summer but when we went, we were the only ones there!</p>
<p>The museum is huge, spanning 2 seperate buildings. There are 3D paintings that you become apart of. Since we were the only customers, an employee decided to be our personal tour guide and photographer. She helped us pose for every photo and insisted on us taking photos together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrew and I had so much fun running around this place! I Imagine it to be less enjoyable when its very busy but we got so lucky!</p>

      <h1>Halong Bay</h1>
      <p>April 14, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>After Cambodia, Andrew and I took a 4 hour shuttle bus to Halong Bay. We had a 1 night Junk cruise booked. A junk boat is what the cruise ships are called at Halong Bay. They are not junky at all. The day before we departed, we received an email letting us know that we had been upgraded to a more luxury cruise!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We arrived at the Halong harbor with throngs of other tourists waiting to embark on their overnight cruises. Our boat was called &#8220;Dragon Legend.&#8221; This was my first time on a cruise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9487-1.jpg"><img src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9487-1.jpg" alt=""></a>&nbsp;<br />
It was such a beautiful experience. Halong Bay is filled with massive limestone rocks that jet out from the water like icebergs. A junk cruise is the best way to get up close to them. We sailed through the rocks during sunset. I was stunned by the natural beauty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9529.jpg"><img src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9529.jpg" alt=""></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

The crew on board was wonderful! They made sure to remember our food allergies whenever food was being served. It was great to meet other tourists from all over the world. We spoke to people from Australia, Spain, England and even Argentina.</p>
<p>You can also kayak, swim and explore a nearby cave. A junk cruise when visiting Halong Bay is a must!</p>

      <h1>Community Tourism</h1>
      <p>April 14, 2016</p>
      <div class="content"><p>After exploring the Banteay Srei temple, we walked further and found a group of locals who offer canoe rides on a lake. After paying $12 USD for 3 of us, we got on a boat with our guide. This turned out to be one of my favorite experiences in Cambodia!</p>
<p>Our guide spoke broken English but was very interested in our lives. He asked about California and he mentioned liking Obama. He let us know that he is 23 years old and desperately wants to attend University. Unfortuntely, school is simply too expensive in Cambodia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9442.jpg"><img src="http://107.170.229.16/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_9442.jpg" alt=""></a>&nbsp;<br />
He also spoke about wanting to get married but being unable to afford the costs associated with a wedding. He was pleased to find out that Andrew and I will wed in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ride was soothing and very eye opening. It was amazing to see the beautiful lake and lily pads. I will never forget this unique experience. We were all pleased to know our money goes directly to the locals, who run the small boat service. There was not another tourist in sight! That really added to the quiet landscape.</p>
