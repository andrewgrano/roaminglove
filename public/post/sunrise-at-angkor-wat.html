It was our first full day in Siem Reap, Cambodia. The hotel packed us a breakfast to go and our tuk tuk driver for the weekend, Mr. Samat, picked us up. After purchasing a $40 3- day pass to the Angkor Wat park, we raced to the sunrise.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at Angkor Wat, we were greeted by hundreds of other tourists who wanted to see the epic sunrise. After waiting for about 30 minutes, the fiery orange sun began to rise. It reflected in the water around us. It was truly a moment I will never forget. Even though I was extremely tired, I don&#8217;t regret it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a very humbling and awe inspiring experience. I was also happy to be there with my best friend Natalie and my fiance Andrew.</p>
<p>Ps. It is VERY hot in Cambodia so by the time the sun rises, it is already about 85 degrees!&nbsp;</p>
