We arranged a taxi through our hotel. The driver was waiting for us as soon as we landed in Cartagena. We loaded up the car and started the 4 hour drive to our first hotel. The drive was pleasant but definitely felt long. At one point, we got stuck in a traffic jam that lasted for 45 minutes. No cars could move so people started getting out of their vehicles and began hanging out in the street. We did as the locals did!</p>

<p>Our driver was nice enough to stop along the way so that Andrew could get a Colombian sim card. We do not speak much Spanish so this would have been difficult without his guidance. There are plenty of rest stops along the way so it was no problem using the restroom or getting more snacks. I enjoyed observing Colombia via car during this drive. We finally arrived to our hotel as the sun was setting.</p>
