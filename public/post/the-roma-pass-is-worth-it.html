        <div class="content"><p>Rome is so beautiful and historical. You can have an entire itinerary for the day or just hang out in the city. You will still feel like you have been transported back in time. There is old stuff everywhere. You will be walking down the street and all of a sudden, a crumbling pillar is on display in front of you. You turn a corner and you see The Colosseum. Rome is also very romantic and it was a treat to walk around, hand in hand. There is so much to do in Rome and unless you have a lot of time to spend in the city, you may want to plan out your days ahead of time. We purchased the Roma Pass online, which offers you easy and pre-paid entry into select museums and transportation while in the city. You can buy the pass for 48 or 72 hours. We bought ours for 72 hours. That allowed us access into 2 museums of our choice, and transportation via buses and metro. The pass cost us $43 USD. We chose to use it on Roman Forum and Baths of Caracalla.</p>

<p>We were so excited to enter the Roman Forum. It is a large outdoor area filled with ancient ruins of old historical buildings. It is located in the center of Rome. The buildings used to be government buildings. I can only assume that the Roman Forum is always packed with tourists. The amount of people really doesn&#8217;t take away from the magic of this place. Throughout all my travels, Roman Forum continues to be one of the most fascinatingÂ places I have visited. I couldn&#8217;t get enough of the crumbling buildings or barely standing pillars. I recommend bringing lots of water as there is barely any shade here. We were here in May and it was pretty hot. We spent almost 2 hours here. You will immediately feel like you have time traveled. Again, don&#8217;t get frustrated with the tour groups and just really try to think about what Rome looked like when these buildings were still standing.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if it was just pure luck but the day we visited the Baths of Caracalla, there was barely anyone else there. These public baths were the 2nd largest in all of Rome and they were built between AD 212 and 217. It blew our minds to be viewing structures so old. You can&#8217;t help but try to imagine what life was like back then. Again, there is not much shade here but once you tour the baths, there is a large green area for sitting. You will find some trees and stray cats. This was the 2nd and last museum we used our Roma Pass on. The Baths of Caracalla are located a bit outside of the city center. The Baths are named after the builder, Caracalla. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You can spend about an hour here or maybe two hours if you like to rest a lot. Luckily, we highly enjoyed the 2 museums we chose to use our Roma Passes on.</p>
