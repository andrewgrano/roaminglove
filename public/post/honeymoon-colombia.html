        <div class="content"><p>Andrew and I got married on June 25th, 2016 in San Diego, California. It was the best day of our lives and we are still in disbelief that we are married to each other. Due to the amount of time that goes into wedding planning, we waited til April to book our honeymoon. In fact, we hadn&#8217;t even decided on a honeymoon destination until mid-April. It was very unlike me to book a trip only 4 months before departing but I had no choice. I was drowning in wedding duties and the last thing on my mind was travel. I was too concerned with my wedding dress fitting me.</p>

<p>If you had asked me 5 years ago where I was going to honeymoon, I would have said &#8220;Paris, France&#8221; without hesitation. Even as a little girl, I wanted to visit Paris with my future &#8220;prince&#8221; one day. When Andrew asked me where I wanted to honeymoon, I surprised myself by not wanting to go to Paris anymore. It suddenly just felt too easy and too crowded. Our last trip in April was to Vietnam and Cambodia. I was still craving culture shock and adventure. I told Andrew the following, &#8220;I want to go somewhere that has warm ocean water but is close to a city to explore. I don&#8217;t want to go to Hawaii or the Caribbean or Mexico.&#8221; I have already been to Hawaii and I have been to Jamaica on two family trips. Mexico seemed too close to home. Andrew came back to after some research and said, &#8220;Cartagena, Colombia.&#8221; The planning began immediately!</p>
<p>Neither of us had been to Colombia or South America before. Cartagena looked so dreamy with its colorful buildings and horse-drawn carriages. We decided to stick to the coast of Colombia; making our way from Tayrona National Park to Cartagena. We gave ourselves 12 days for our Honeymoon.</p>
<p>The next series of posts will be about my experience in Colombia. I will review hotels, treks, parks, beaches and of course, Cartagena. Enjoy!</p>
